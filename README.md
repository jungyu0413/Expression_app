# Facial Expression Recognition App

This is a PyQt5-based desktop application that integrates **face detection** and **facial expression recognition** using deep learning models. It supports the following input modes:

- **Live Camera Streaming** (real-time expression inference)
- **Image Files** (single or multiple faces)
- **Video Files** (single-face inference)

The app detects faces in the input, performs expression classification, and visualizes the probability distribution of seven emotions in a clean and interactive UI.

## Features

- Multi-face detection and expression recognition on static images
- Single-face recognition from images or video files
- Real-time expression inference via live webcam
- Softmax-based expression probability visualization
- Clean Qt interface with dynamic layout scaling
