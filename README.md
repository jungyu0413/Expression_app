# Facial Expression Recognition App

This project provides a PyQt-based application for detecting faces and recognizing facial expressions from various input sources. It supports:

- Live webcam input
- Single/multiple face images
- Video file input

The app detects one or more faces in the input, classifies the facial expressions, and visualizes the probability distribution of predicted emotions in real-time.
